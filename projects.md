excerpt: Side projects and fun challenges.
---

I am currently redesigning my site so bear with me, I am arranging projects into database built projects such as [Point_Of_Sale.ts](), [Book_Collection.ts](), and [Inventory.ts](). Then onto simple [Number and String]() manipulation modules I wrote to solve code challanges such as [Fibbonaci sequences](), [Tower of Hanoi](), and other popular algorithms. I am mainly a backend developer writting software for data science and devOps. I am a lifelong user of Linux and use a Chromebook for development. Click on the "code" link will take you to the repo for the project to view code while I am building the web interface.
