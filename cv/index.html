<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Welcome to my CV</h1>
	<p>I will add a nice looking resume to this eventually, I am just getting setup. I graduated HS, went to ASA college in Brooklyn for Network Administration and Web security, EWU for computer science and landed jobs in the tech sector as a Linux admin for GoDaddy for a short time and a case manager for DirecTV technical support working with broadcasting, engineering and other core groups to diagnose issues that were beyond a simple phone call and service tech.</p>
	<p>I decided to work as a Freelancer and spent most of my time building up clients and finding work on various freelancer sites. I had enough clients to keep myself very busy until I lost most of my vision. I had to go for a while unemployed while I got on disability and lost everything in the process (very humbling) but now I am in a stable place and have decided to get some adaptive tech and get back to work.</p>
    <p>I have been trying to get back into the game as a fullstack developer using Javascript primarily as my language of choice, I am also comfortable using Python, TypeScript, and a couple other languages, stay tuned to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/snuthern/portfolio/wiki">portfolio repo</a> for more projects as I add them. If you would like to discuss potential employment please reach out as I am interested.</p>
