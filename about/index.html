	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Joseph, and I am a semi-blind web developer working out of North Carolina. I was in the IT field as a Linux System Admin and Tier III tech support case manager but as I started to lose more and more vision I had to step aside. Now I have a chromebook and a quarantine to keep me inside all day, so I figured why not pick up some JavaScript and document my progress. If you would like to get in touch, please reach out to me anytime.</p>
