	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Joseph, and I am a semi-blind web developer working out of North Carolina. I was in the IT field as a Linux System Admin and Tier III tech support case manager but as I started to lose more and more vision I had to step aside. Now I mainly work freelance on server related issues and Node.Js apps. I also use TypeScript and ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).</p>
	<p>I am also one of the main creators of the "JavaScript Community Hub" on Discord. We are a small community of developers and newbies who mentor up and comers on Node.Js, Deno and other languages in order to help them learn to contribute to Github repos and build up better portfolios and contribute to open source software in the process.</p>
	<p>If you would like to join us and contribute to one of our repos, join us over on the server and ask how to get involved.</p>
