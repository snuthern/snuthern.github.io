# BLM Tribute Pages

This page was started after the death of George Floyd and the protests that ensued and have continued across the US due to escelating police violence in response to the protests. It has now gotten to the point that there are open kidnappings of peaceful citizens exercising their rights.

I decided to create "Tribute Pages" for each person of color murdered by police this year. Follow the links to see their page, and to donate to their GoFundMe campaign if there is one. I will also include various other pages in response to police actions and injured protestors.
