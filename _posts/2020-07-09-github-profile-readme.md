Recently GitHub rolled out README files for profiles, this makes it easier to have gh as your professional profile page. It also gave me the push I needed to delete my portfolio repo and switch over to a monorepo. Being a miminalist I really like the idea of a monorepo, it allows me to keep all my side projects in one repo and not clutter up my profile with repos that aren't really professional.  
  
In order to create one of these new files just head over to your profile and create a new repo, name it your github username `snuthern/snuthern` this is not your gh-pages repo `snuthern/snuthern.github.io` these two serve different needs. Once you set up the new repo with a README it will have a simple template already prepared so you can fill it out and showcase you.
