title: "Learning.Js Is TOUGH!!"

I enjoy working with JavaScript, it is one of my main languages that I develop in. I get questions from many newbies to the code world about how difficult it is. It has progressed so much though compared to the late 90s when it was first developing online. You couldn't really do anything cool with it you just were able to add some features to websites that made for a *"better UI/UX"* for the user. Most people who visited websites disagreed.  
  
Mainly you would see people using it for buttons and flashing images or something ridiculous like that. We couldn't yet really manipulate the DOM like we can now, and jQuery was not yet invented. You couldn't use it for data and the crazy amount of things you can today. It was unheard of for someone to be able to create a http server and host a website just using JavaScript.  
  
Now with the emergence of TypeScript we have the added functionality of being able to add types to JavaScript. This is more an aspect of enterprise development and it isn't something most web developers are even used to messing with. Some of the languages you learn after JavaScript have more use in corporate work. Some are better used for game development, some are better used for databases and ORM.  
  
There is a whole world out there after you learn JavaScript  
Never stop learning!
