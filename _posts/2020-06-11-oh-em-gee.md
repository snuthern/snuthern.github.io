I have been using Github for years and never have I ever done some mess like this!! I am creating a Deno module for Discord called **DiscordTS** keep an eye out for it. I created the repo on github and cloned it locally. I then went about my normal process of workflow and for three days I worked on this project and added numerous files and folders. I then went about the normal process of pushing my changes to github with one minor change. I was using the `git commit -am "Message` shorthand to add files to the staging area, but wasn't looking at exactly what it was staging.  
  
I pushed all of my changes and was doing some reordering on my repo directory. I had a few to rename and move and a couple to delete. I deleted the local copy since the repo is always there on GIthub.... So later I login to GH and go to my repo and guess what? Nothing there... Somehow the shorthand `git commit -am "Message"` doesn't do the same thing as adding all files via `git add *` so all that was there was 2 files I had changed.  
  
So here I sit, coding the entire freaking thing again :D  
Lesson learned, Until next time....
