Since the Coronavirus pandemic hit America there have been many APIs built to pull the data for new infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and more. I wanted to start learning Express.js so I set out to build a simple dashboard where I could view data for my State and I figured create it so others from other States could do the same.

At first "routing" made no sense to me, why do I need to create 3 seperate files just to have a simple HTML page render, but I got over that. After I somewhat got the basics of rendering down I started building. I enjoy the ease of being able to create URL parameters the way Express does, Im going to jump into Angular, Vue, React and more once I get this one built to what I envision.

If you would like to take a look at my project and send me some constructive criticism I would be more than happy to hear from you. You can find the link to my Discord ID on my profile. Until then I am going back to working on this and will post some more in a few days.
