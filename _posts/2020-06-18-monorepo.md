I have been in the process of moving my portfolio repo over to a "Monorepo" I first heard of this idea a while back and didn't really know of many people doing it so I haven't moved it over yet. In deciding to create a monorepo the most appealing part to me is the idea of one code base to hold them all. I am a tad OCD and so for me this idea was very appealing. I only need one `package.json` file in the base of the repo and load everything from there.  
  
I want to make my [Portfolio](https://github.com/snuthern/portfolio) repo a monorepo. This seemed like the most obvious choice for me since I dont really like having 15 different repos just to showcase your skills. Why not host them all in one file and display accordingly? I am going to be doing the projects listed in the ["Karan"](https://github.com/karan/Projects) list. It has a nice assortment of simple and useable projects. I also found another list [here](https://itnext.io/42-projects-to-practice-programming-skills-6f5acc10fec0) that has some really practical project ideas I will also use in this repo.
