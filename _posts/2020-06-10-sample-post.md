I have been searching around for a new theme. I am in the process of creating my own Jekyll blog theme, but until I am done I wanted to use something simple and minimal. I have a few things going on at the moment so forgive me if it takes a while to move everything over. 

I have a few side-projects on the burner. A simple point-of-sale system written in TypeScript, with a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) backend served up on Heroku with a web interface to buy and sell products for the admin and a cash register app for the users.

I also like to develop system tools and information security tools in my free time. I am currently working on a subdomain scanner for Node.js that uses DNSmapper API to get IP addresses and subdomains and send them to a generated snapshot. You can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/snuthern) to see these tools as they are developed.
