# Free Cloud IDE With Perks!
I love to find free resources online for developers and this one is amazing! Many times I am asked for a free resource to somewhere to develop node apps or typescript apps. I found this little gem a while back and have been testing it. They set you up on the free account with 5 "containers", a CLoud IDE connected to your container and 10 Gigs to play around with.  
  
  You also have access to a Linux server of your choosing when you set up. They support numerous languages out of the box and I have really enjoyed it so far. I set up a CodeAnywhere account and it was a little tough to understand where everything is, how to install, etc. None of those problems greeted me on [Goorm.io](https://goorm.io) I was up and running in no time, and with only a couple of dollars a month I can upgrade to a persistant box with way more features.  
    
Combine Goorm + DigitalOcean and build your own development web server for a fraction of the cost.
