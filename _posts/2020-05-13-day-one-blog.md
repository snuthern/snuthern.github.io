Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I just wanted to get a post up so I can call it a blog. Sometimes it is tough for me to be consistant with a blog so I will try to be more about this one.  
  
I use a variety of JavaScript libraries and frameworks on the daily as a freelance developer, I also run a Discord server dedicated to pairing new programmers with older mentors who can help them learn to write cleaner more efficient code. We mainly use Discords API and YouTube API and our own internal API to teach emerging coders how to communicate with the servers and improve their own skills.  
  
Feel free to stop by our server and get to know the crew, we have members from all over the world who sign on all different times so you are bound to meet someone. We have giveaways and prizes for our regular members and more. Discord URL is [here](https://dicord.gg/mhMrZzk), we teach everything from UI/UX design and wireframing an app / website, all the way up to how to code your own server and site in Node.Js and manage your own modules within that site.
