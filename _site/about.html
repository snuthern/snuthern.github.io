I started learning JavaScript about 15 years ago when the web was really just becoming a thing, long before google, facebook, myspace, youtube, any of that.

I became a freelancer and went into web development. I got more into the server side of things and had another friend creating sites on the front end and graphics and all of that while I took care of the server and all of the features users needed. I set up and configured DNS / MAIL / IRC / SQL / Apache and more for our customers as needed.</p><p>Once the internet took off I had a nice little web business and some consulting on the side.
