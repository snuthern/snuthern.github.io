I am an old techie, I got started while I was in my first semester on Computer Science classes in NY. I was taking vb.net class and I got hired as a teachers aide to help new programmers. I already knew a bit of python and had bought a laptop and installed Linux, so he figured I knew a good bit already.

I was completing classes towards my Assosciates in Network Admin and web security. I got hired by my math professor (Avishek Agarwal) to create a POS (point of sale) software and network the systems for him. I worked in NY, NJ, MA and more installing cables and peripherals and then networking them all together. 

Avi eventually had to go back to India and the company dissolved (since it was just the two of us) I did a few weeks working with AutoCAD for a friend and started finding freelance gigs in the city to develop software and fix bugs. That is where I decided to just be a freelancer.
