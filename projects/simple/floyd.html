			<p>George Floyd was an African-American man who died on May 25, 2020, after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for at least seven minutes, while he was handcuffed and lying facedown on the road. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng also helped restrain Floyd, while officer Tou Thao stood nearby and looked on. The incident occurred during an arrest of Floyd in Powderhorn, a neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was recorded on cell phone video by several bystanders. The video recordings, showing Floyd repeatedly saying "I can't breathe," were widely circulated on social media platforms and broadcast by the media. The four officers involved were fired the next day.</p>
			<p>Days after the arrest there are still ongoing protests in many cities in the United States, however we already know the outcome. Another panel of cops will clear this murderer of all wrong doing and give him a bonus and a promotion most likely, he may be shuffled onto another department but no charges will come of it. If any charge is brought it will be a minor charge and most likely dismissed immediately. Our Justice system is broken and it seems there is no remedy.</p>
