		<p>Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, aged 25, graduated from Brunswick High School in 2012. He attended South Georgia Technical College during fall 2012 and spring 2013 to pursue a career as an electrician. He frequently jogged for exercise in and around his neighborhood. He was murdered by three white men.

		<p>It's sad that in America we have to see so many stories of young and old, men and women of color being gunned down for nothing more than existing. This young man was jogging through a neighborhood and stopped in a property to look at it for a moment and then carried on about his business.</p>
		<p>It is for the reason of raising awareness of systemic racism in America that I create this tribute page to Ahmaud Arbery, <a href="floyd.html">"George Floyd"</a> another man on color who's life was literally choked out of him by another racist police officer.</p>
