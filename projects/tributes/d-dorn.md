On June 2, 2020, Dorn was discovered on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn and Jewelry around 2:30 am. He had reportedly been responding to the burglar alarm of his friend's pawn shop when he was fatally shot by unknown looters. His death was streamed on Facebook live.

The 13-minute video was briefly taken down by Facebook before being reinstated with a warning screen and has been viewed more than 94,000 times as of June 3. In the video, a young man states: "Oh my God, cuz....They just killed this old man at the pawn shop over some TVs....c'mon, man, thats somebody's granddaddy."
