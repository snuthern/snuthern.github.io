Monterrosa, a 22-year-old San Francisco resident, was shot and killed by an officer in Vallejo, California. The officer thought Monterrosa had a gun in his pocket, but instead, it was a hammer, Police Chief Shawny Williams said Wednesday, CBS San Francisco reports.  
  
Police arrived at a Walgreens in Vallejo as it was being looted on Tuesday, Williams said. Officers chased two vehicles as they fled, and one rammed a police car and injured an officer.   
  
Officers saw Monterrosa approach the car. "This individual appeared to be running toward the black sedan but suddenly stopped, taking a kneeling position and placing his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun," said Williams.  
  
"Investigations later revealed that the weapon was a long, 15-inch hammer tucked into the pocket of his sweatshirt. Due to this perceived threat, one officer fired his weapon five times from within the police vehicle through the windshield, striking the suspect once, fatally wounding the suspect."  
  
Monterrosa was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The officer who fired at him is a 13-year veteran with the force whose identity will be made public in the coming days, CBS San Francisco reported.  
  
Wednesday's press conference ended abruptly when some protesters gathered outside City Hall began to shout at Williams, demanding answers as to why the officer opened fire on a man who was on his knees. "At what point do you arrest him and make an example out of all these officers and arrest him?" one woman shouted, according to CBS San Francisco. "Fire him! Not paid leave! Fire him for killing a man that was on his knees!"
