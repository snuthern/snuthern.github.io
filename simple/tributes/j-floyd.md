Floyd, 35, died in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday after being pepper-sprayed by staff, according to a news release from the federal Bureau of Prisons.  
  
Officials said pepper spray was used when Floyd became increasingly disruptive and it was believed he could be potentially harmful to himself and others. Medical staff tried to revive him but were unsuccessful.  
  
Floyd's mother said her son suffered from asthma and diabetes and that jail officials were aware of his health conditions. "They maced my son," Donna Mays told the Daily News. "They murdered my son."  
  
The news release regarding Floyd's death was widely circulated online, with many sharing it with #SayTheirNames or similar hashtags.   
  
"The US Bureau of Prisons pepper-sprayed a man to death today at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Sunset Park (where we have protested inhumane conditions time & time again and will be back, tragically, tomorrow). He was 35.#SayHisName: Jamel Floyd," New York City Council Member Brad Lander tweeted.   
  
"This report out of the MDC Brooklyn is horrifying! BOP must secure all evidence and videos and we will be demanding an immediate and thorough investigation," New York Congressman Jerry Nadler wrote.   
  
"If inhaled pepper spray can cause elevations of blood pressure leading to heart attacks & stroke and exacerbate potentially fatal asthma attacks," tweeted Dr. Victoria Dooley. "#JamelFloyd was pepper-sprayed to death by police. His life mattered."
