title: RIP Rayshard Brooks
---

On June 12, 2020 Rayshard Brooks (26) was sleeping peacefully in his car in a Wendy's parking lot when management called police on him. They showed up and escelated the situation to the point there was a struggle, in this struggle Mr Brooks got hold of the officers taser (A NON LETHAL WEAPON) and was able to flee, as he ran away he turned and pointed the taser at the officer and then was killed.  
  
He had plans to go celebrate his daughters birthday the next day, now another set of children have no father in their life, because of police whos answer to anything done while black is to murder. Rayshard had three children, he had taken his daughter out earlier that day to get her nails done and have a nice meal together. He was ASLEEP...... in a car, and for that was murdered. I will update this post with GoFundMe links as soon as I see them.
