My name is Joseph, and I go by **"Yossi"** you can find me chatting in Discord usually. I started learning JavaScript about 15 years ago when the web was really just becoming a thing, long before google, facebook, myspace, youtube, any of that. I got a degree in Network Admin and Security in 2002 shortly after 9/11 (I was a resident of NYC at the time) and started down the programming path with VB.NET my teacher liked how fast I took to it and gave me a job working with him learning python and doing network administration for POS systems across NY / NJ / CT   

I eventually worked my way into a job as a Linux admin for GoDaddy and worked with them and DirecTV until I burnt out on the whole corporate workforce. I became a freelancer and went into web development. I got more into the server side of things and had another friend creating sites on the front end and graphics and all of that while I took care of the server and all of the features users needed. I set up and configured DNS / MAIL / IRC / SQL / Apache and more for our customers as needed.  

Once the internet took off I had a nice little web business and some consulting on the side. If you would like to see a ["Resume"](/resume) click the link, if you have Discord and would like to discuss a project or some work with me then follow the link to our server [here](https://discord.gg/mhMrZzk) where we discuss anything JavaScript / TypeScript / Deno related and help one another become better developers.
