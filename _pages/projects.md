### Simple Tribute Pages
  
This year, due to the numerous protests, I decided to dedicate a simple *tribute* page for each of the black lives lost this year to police violence against innocent, unarmed, compliant people of color and leave links to their families GoFundMe page if they have one.

MonoRepo... Recently Github rolled out README.md pages for profiles. This makes profiles a little more like portfolios for people to view. I decided it was time to move my portfolio over to a monorepo, The idea is to only have a minimum of repos on my profile. One for my profile "snuthern" one for my blog "snuthern.github.io" and maybe ones I fork to contribute to. This is a work in progress. Follow my blog for more.
