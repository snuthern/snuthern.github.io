### Simple Tribute Pages
  
This year, due to the numerous protests, I decided to dedicate a simple *tribute* page for each of the black lives lost this year to police violence against innocent, unarmed, compliant people of color and leave links to their families GoFundMe page if they have one.

I have plans to link more projects on here I am just busy working on projects and not ready to link them here yet, you can see them on GitHub but they arent ready for production yet. I am in the process of moving my [Portfolio]() repo into what is called a "monorepo" where all your projects are stored in one repo and one package.json file to control them all. I deleted most of my repos except this `gh-pages` one for this Jekyll project and the ones I have forked to contrib on. Give me some time please :D
