### Simple Tribute Pages
  
This year, due to the numerous protests, I decided to dedicate a simple *tribute* page for each of the black lives lost this year to police violence against innocent, unarmed, compliant people of color and leave links to their families GoFundMe page if they have one.

### Dev Tools  
  
These are just simple tools I created to aid in daily work, simple math is just basic math formulas in a easy to use module so I can use them along side **Math**, wireframe is a simple to use wireframing app to design out your website or app, studio bootsrap is a free version of bootstrap studio because paying for that would be stupid....

### JsDevs Pro
  
Just a site I bought and play around on, sometimes people email me there and I create deno / node apps on it as well. I will list them below as I have time
