      <h3>snuthern@github</h3>
      <p class="lead">My passion is JavaScript and TypeScript, I also am loving Deno so far and look forward to working with more of it.</p>
      <p>I develop Javascript apps and packages with Node.Js and have been doing so for a while. I am a freelance software developer living on a farm with some livestock and crops and spend my free time helping people solve problems with programs online. I also love math and solving challenges on some popular algorithmic challenge sites, links below</p>
      <p>Thank you for stopping by my site and feel free to email me or send a message on discord for suggestions and criticisms. I look forward to hearing from you</p>
