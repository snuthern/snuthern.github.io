<p>My passion is JavaScript, ES6, and TypeScript. I develop Node.Js apps and packages, I also mentor up and coming developers in how to create and maintain packages on github and contribute to open source software. I also run a server for helping people learn to code Deno / TypeScript apps and host them for free online where others can see their projects.</p>
<p>I also admin a Discord server where we communicate and hang out throughout the day. If you would like to have some work done or need help with some code that insnt running correctly then please feel free to stop by and let us help, we have users from all over the world who work with all types of frameworks like Angular, Ember, Firebase, Express, and more</p>
<p>On the Navbar you will find links to my projects on this site and a link to my portfolio for more work as well as my resume and how to contact me if you would like to communicsate further. I am currently taking courses to get more certificates online while we are locked down due to COVID in order to feel more productive.</p>
